## Five key points about my website:

- User Authentication: My project includes user authentication, allowing users to register and log in to their accounts. This feature provides a secure and personalized experience for users.
- Food Addition: Users can add new food to the system. They can input the food name, food image,food quantity, pickup location, expired date and quality of the new food. This data is sent to the server via a POST request.
- Food Display: In my project displays a list of foods associated with a specific food. Users can view foods from a particular email, and the foods are presented in a grid layout. This provides a way to showcase a food's catalog.
- Food Request: My project includes a food request feature. Users can add foods to their my food request, and the request contents are displayed in a tabular form. Users can interact with the request, such as removing requests.
- Food Details View: Users can access detailed information about a specific food. When users click on a food's view details button, they are redirected to a food details page. Here, they can see more information about the food, including its name, pickup location, expired date, food quantity, donator image,donator name and food image.
