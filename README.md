- User Authentication: My project includes user authentication, allowing users to register and log in to their accounts. This feature provides a secure and personalized experience for users.
- Food Addition: Users can add new food to the system. They can input the food name, food image,food quantity, pickup location, expired date and quality of the new food. This data is sent to the server via a POST request.
